The service downtime affected the web application, resulting in a complete outage for all users. Approximately 95% of users were unable to access the platform during the incident.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
Timeline:

10:15 PM PDT:
The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server error rates.
10:20 PM PDT:
Engineers initiated an investigation into potential causes, focusing on backend server health and network connectivity.
11:00 PM PDT:
Initial assumption pointed towards database overload, leading to a thorough inspection of database query performance and indexing strategies.
12:30 AM PDT:
Misleading investigation paths led to exploring potential application code issues, resulting in a code review session by the development team.
1:30 AM PDT:
With no significant findings, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further analysis.
2:00 AM PDT:
Upon detailed examination, the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was identified as the root cause.
3:00 AM PDT:
The incident was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration, restoring normal service functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused traffic to be improperly distributed among backend servers, leading to service degradation and eventual downtime.
Resolution:
The issue was fixed by adjusting the load balancer configuration to properly distribute incoming requests among backend servers based on their capacity and health status.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated checks for load balancer configuration consistency.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect load balancer-related issues in real-time.
Develop and maintain comprehensive documentation for load balancer setup and configuration best practices.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Update load balancer configuration script to enforce proper settings.
Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations across environments.
Schedule regular audits to ensure load balancer configurations align with best practices and business requirements.
